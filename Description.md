# Description
Below are some example question. You can write in your own format.

## What are the steps you took to approach this assignment?
at first, I read the entire document within an hour to understand the requirements of the project.
I divided the assignment into smaller parts and I started doing it,


main parts 1. ui development
           2. functional development  


In this, I started with the skeleton of the project with basic JSX components. then I used to create one-by-one pages based on the difficult level

## How much time did you spend on each step?
understanding the projet   = 1hr
setting the basic structure = 30 min
created the routing and basic pages lay outs  = 30 mins 
adding the the basic css to the jsx pages = 1hour 
expense page just ui and design = 30 min 
add expense page = 2 hrs
category list page = 2hrs
category removie list = 2hrs
edit expense  = 3hrs
writing the document took me 30 min
and i took little bit 20 min to add some lasr media queries

## What are some challenges you have in this assignment?  

I felt the most difficulty in 2 places first the UI designing part, I made the bottom buttons stick to the end of the screen but on one page it did not work as expected it took more time of mine.
2 in the edit expense page, Sorry first I used the normal good way of writing code but because of time constraints, I took the time.


## What are the steps that you decide not to do? What are the reason for it?
I only kept the edit expense page 70% complete because I had a lot of questions on that page so I kept the page 30% complete


1. if I edit the total amount in the category how do I need to edit the things with the all dates?


if I get a chance we will discuss this directly

## What are some TODO enhancement for this app?

it's just my opinion.


1, having the monthly expense is good but first we need to show the user when the user entered the date, then he can use the filters to make their choice to see their expenditure.


adding filters is the best option on this expense page so that we can know more about the user behavior.
and changing the UI design.
